	 * It implements the standard onResult function that is called upon succesfully invoking a service.
	 * That function in return calls the handler function that was used to create te Adaptor.
	 * Example:
	 * 
	 * remoteObject.someOperation.addEventListener("result", new ResultToFunctionAdaptor(handleResultOfOperation).onResult);
